*Nate's Clock

This is a simple program which works with an Arduino burned Atmel and a hand full of old counter chips (74L516 and 4024) I had lying around and some 7 segment LEDs and a speaker code. Basically the Arduino is used to host an Alarm Clock for my son Nate. It shows the time, scrolls 'secret' messages, and plays two different songs through the speaker.

A video of the "computer" before it went in the case is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpshfs3g9n4
